        <pre>
    I can't help but be destructive right now
    It's been weeks since I saw your outline
    In my room is a silence so loud
    This is what losing hope might sound like

    Put me down so I'm in my place
    Say it's over for breathing space
    All I was was a route to change
    Is this just growing up?

    I might seem too distracted right now
    It's been so long I've been the punchline
    I stand naked while these clothes dry out
    Leave me drowning to edit the runtime

    Put me down so I'm in my place
    Say it's over for breathing space
    All I was was a route to change
    Is this just growing up?

    All this love could not seal my fate
    Low is all that I've been of late
    Caught in webs I wove with my mistakes
    But this is growing up

    I can't help it but I love you so
    I can't take this letting go
    I still feel that we could work it out or something
    All I am is only flesh and bone
    Why's your heart so freezing cold?
    Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (hey)

    I can't help it but I love you so
    I can't take this letting go
    I still feel that we could work it out or something
    All I am is only flesh and bone
    Why's your heart so freezing cold?
    Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (no, I can't help it, no)

    I can't help it, but I love you so (no, I can't help it, no)
    I can't take this lettin' go (I will never let you go)
    I still feel that we could work it out or somethin' (I will never let you go)
    (No, I can't help it, no)
    All I am is only flesh and bone (no, I can't help it, no)
    Why's your heart so freezin' cold? (I will never let you go)
    Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (I will never let you go)
